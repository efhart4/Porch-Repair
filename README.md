Overview:
    I’m planning to stabilize my porch because of poor construction and rot. I’ve attached sketches showing the [existing layout](https://github.com/efhart4/Porch-Repair/blob/main/Technical%20Drawing.png), as well as some photos of the current condition [Full front view](https://github.com/efhart4/Porch-Repair/blob/main/Full%20front%20view.jpeg).

Problems:
1.	Rim joist is rotten.
2.	[right brick stack](https://github.com/efhart4/Porch-Repair/blob/main/right%20brick%20stack.jpeg) sits under the rim joist instead of the far-right beam. 

Proposed Improvements:
1.	Replace the existing footings with cement footings and posts.
2.	Install a new rim joist.
3.	Add new stairs.

Questions:
1.	Should I build a temporary wall inside during the work?

    A. Might be easy to do and potentially save a ton of damage.
  	 
2.	Can I just jack up the two beams? [technical drawing](https://github.com/efhart4/Porch-Repair/blob/main/Technical%20Drawing.png)

    A. Use a jack at each beam and a third at the stairs.
  	
3.	Supports should be every 8 ft, Should I put another support under the 14ft span? Is the [blocking](https://github.com/efhart4/Porch-Repair/blob/main/blocking%20and%20wood%20supports.jpeg) enough?

  	A. yes, the blocking will be enough for now.
