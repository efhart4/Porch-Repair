I’m planning to stabilize my porch because of poor construction and rot. I’ve attached sketches showing the (existing layout), as well as some photos of the current condition (Full front view).

Problems:
1.	Rim joist is rotten.
2.	Far right footing sits under the rim joist instead of the far-right beam. See (right brick stack).

Proposed Improvements:
1.	Replace the existing footings with cement footings and posts.
2.	Install a new rim joist.
3.	Add new stairs. 

Questions:
1.	Should I build a temporary wall inside during the work?
2.	Can I just jack up the center beam  and the beam on the right side?
3.	Supports should be every 8 ft, Should I put another support under the 14ft span? Is the blocking enough ()?
